      <description>I can't believe this game is free!! Really incredible game.

Crafting your build during a run is thoughtful, and feels great.

The meta-progression is robust and multifaceted.

Seems like there are some secrets to uncover as well! Looking forward to all of it.</description>

      <description> It might be the best survivors-style game so far. Comparable to Rogue genesia.</description>

      <description>Amazing Rougelite survivors bullet hell game.
The graphics might not be the best, but the game is free anyway, but it definitely makes up with the interesting ways you can upgrade your character in a run.
Mechanically it's one of the best ones out there.</description>
